Fix for an incorrect ``freeze`` warning message due to a package being
included in multiple requirements files that were passed to ``freeze``.
Instead of warning incorrectly that the package is not installed, pip
now warns that the package was declared multiple times and lists the
name of each requirements file that contains the package in question.
